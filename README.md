# Mac Mute Startup Chime

Automatically prevents the [macOS startup chime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_startup#Startup_chime) by muting when shutting down and unmutes on startup.  
Does not unmute if system was already muted at shut down.

Note that this is only for [older Macs](https://pingie.com/2016/10/28/apple-says-goodbye-to-the-startup-chime-with-the-new-macbook-pro/) (pre October 2016), which have the startup chime.

Tested on macOS High Sierra (10.13.4)
